Iâ€™m a dabbler so sometimes I mess around with technologies like: Docker, Terraform, AWS Web Services, Linux configuration, CI, Bash scripting, Go, Rust, networking, contracting - Iâ€™ve dabbled enough to understand a full stack system.

My curiosity in various areas of tech stack on/off my day job means I can to talk to and communicate effectively with people in other areas.
